{"name":"Shaman","tagline":"A simple folder locker","body":"## shaman for developers ##\r\n\r\n**Howdy!** this is shaman, a folder locker.\r\n\r\n## a word ##\r\n\r\nShaman currently it is on a \"experimental\" build, leaving in consideration that many features will be added later. Also i would like to say this is going to be updated weekly, as well as my work on LeprechaunProject. Oh, don't know what it is? Checkout [here!](https://github.com/lelufg/shelleprechaun/)\r\n\r\n## back to business ##\r\n\r\nLet's make a parsing features present on shaman's actual build.\r\n\r\n - Implemented locking system\r\n - Direct and simple. No bullshit.\r\n - Open source (duh)\r\n \r\n ## where is the linux version, dickhead? ##\r\n**Why such aggressive? :(**\r\nLinux version will be added later, there is some stuff i need to change before release it, otherwise it will bug all over your desktop. You wouldn't like if this happen, right? \r\n\r\n## what language? ##\r\nWell, for Windows there is BATCH, and for Linux (in a proper future) there is SHELL. Dunno if i'll add some ports for Python or Cpp, who knows :p\r\n\r\n## can i share or edit? ##\r\nSure but keep in mind that is my work and I've done this by myself. Put some credits at the end and everything will be fine.\r\n\r\n## any advice? ##\r\nF*ck some pussies.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
