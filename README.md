## shaman for developers ##

**Howdy!** this is shaman, a folder locker.

## a word ##

Shaman currently it is on a "experimental" build, leaving in consideration that many features will be added later. Also i would like to say this is going to be updated weekly, as well as my work on LeprechaunProject. Oh, don't know what it is? Checkout [here!](https://github.com/lelufg/shelleprechaun/)

## back to business ##

Let's make a parsing features present on shaman's actual build.

 - Implemented locking system
 - Direct and simple. No bullshit.
 - Open source (duh)
 
 ## where is the linux version, dickhead? ##
**Why such aggressive? :(**
Linux version will be added later, there is some stuff i need to change before release it, otherwise it will bug all over your desktop. You wouldn't like if this happen, right? 

## what language? ##
Well, for Windows there is BATCH, and for Linux (in a proper future) there is SHELL. Dunno if i'll add some ports for Python or Cpp, who knows :p

## can i share or edit? ##
Sure but keep in mind that is my work and I've done this by myself. Put some credits at the end and everything will be fine.

## any advice? ##
F*ck some pussies.
